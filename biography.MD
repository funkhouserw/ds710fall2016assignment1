## 1. What is your name?

My name is Wilson Funkhouser

## 2. Why are you interested in Data Science?

Data is infiltrating our world. From Analytics to app design to, well... everything.
I want to utilize data in fun and interesting ways, especially as it relates
to behavioral psychology and product design. 

## 3. Tell us a little bit about your programming experience.
#### What programming courses have you taken?  
#### Do you use programming on the job, and if so, how?

I've worked for the past few years doing software consulting for small businesses and
startups that either needed to get an application into beta or needed some "intrapreneurship"

This has led to me working as a UX designer, product and project manager, and developer. 
My main stack is ruby/rails, though I also have some experience with a few other frameworks like node.
I've done a lot of front-end development, so I also have experience with html/css frameworks
such as Bourbon, Sass, Less, and Foundation. 

I have opinions on code style and best practices, especially as they relate to using
object-oriented CSS or BEM.
I also have opinions about test coverage. 

## 4.  Tell us a little bit about your statistics experience. 
#### What statistics courses have you taken?
#### Do you use statistics on the job, and if so, how?

My first job out of college was designing a portfolio management tool used 
(at the time) by WSJ and a 401k planning tool. 
Statistics played a large part in the product's direction as well as the UX 
and design of the app. 

Once I moved onto project management and consulting, I was adamant about data-driven UX and product design. 
Whether conducting surveys or analyzing web traffic, I've been able to embrace some level of statistics in my day to day job.

My undergraduate degree was in Mathematics, Economics, and Psychology. All three of these required some knowledge and use of statistics.
But this is my chance to start exploring the field much more deeply and thoughtfully.

## 5.  Do you have other experience with R or Python?

Other than a little bit of Python for batch image processing and a few other server-side automated processes,
I have very limited Python Experience.  Similarly, other than DS700, I have very limited R experience. 

## 6.  What do you hope to learn in this class?

Other than develop a better grasp of how Python is used for Data Science,
I'm very interested in learning and discussing standard practices in the field.
Research-heavy fields have a stereotype of not following a lot of standard practices
for software development (test coverage, code style, version control, deployment practices)
and I'm very interested in learning if this is actually true or how it is changing.

## 7.  Is there anything else you would like to share with us?

I've mentioned this somewhere else, but I love being able to communicate freely with everyone. 
As such, I created a channel for us UW Data Science Folk on the increasingly-popular chat app 'Slack'. 

You can sign up [here](http://uwds-slack.herokuapp.com/) for free.  It's super useful.
Feel free to create rooms for all of your other classes and invite everyone else! 

Also, I responded to this prompt in markdown because github supports it and it's so much prettier!
